Module 6 APIs
Initially had issues with geoviews dependencies and AskBCS helped me fix it, had to reinstall Anaconda and run this command "conda install -c pyviz hvplot geoviews"
geoviews will not install outside of Anaconda. In the process I installed a library called folium to create the maps as I thought I was not going to be able to fix geoviews. I left the folium code. Check the map here output_data/map_created_with_folium.html
You can see the maps created with hvplot here output_data/map_created_with_hvplot.html and here "output_data/hotel_map_created_with_hvplot.html
